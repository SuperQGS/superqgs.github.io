        <p><i>An infinite number of monkeys, given an infinite number of typewriters, and an infinite amount of time, will eventually reproduce the complete works of Willium Shakespeare.</i></p>
        <p>Hi. What you see above is a little project I made in study hall. It might just look like random static, and, well, that <i>is</i> what it is, but there's more to it than that.</p>
        <p>You see, it truly is RANDOM static. Every pixel of the 100x50 screen is given a random color, for every frame. Essentially, each frame is just a randomly generated image. So most of the time, it will look like colorful static. <i>Most</i> of the time.</p>
        <p>Because of it's inherent randomness, there is a chance, while small, for <i>literally anything</i>  to be generated. Any combination of pixels on the screen have a chance of showing up.</p>
        <p>Pictures of space, cats, classified documents, and the Hoover Dam are all possible. This could even included a frame from, for example, Star Wars.</p>
        <p>If a frame from a video can generate, then, though it is an astronomically small chance, the next frame could also generate the following frame. Then the next, and the next, and so on.</p>
        <p>This means that not only can any picture be generated, but also any video.</p>
        <p>Of course, the chance of this happening is insanely small, but if you watched it long enough, say an infinite amount of time, you would see <i>everything.</i></p>
        <p>Every movie that has ever come out. Every movie that hasn't come out. Every movie that will ever come out.</p>
        <p>Historical battles with 100% accuracy.</p>
        <p>Entire lives, from the person's perspective, birth to death. In fact, <i>Every</i> life. From other angles as well.</p>
        <p>You're not looking at random static. You're looking at a time machine. You're looking at the universe. You're looking at everything.<p>
      
        
        <p><i>but why such a low resolution?</i> I actually tried a 1080p resolution, however each frame took way too long to render. Though this might not matter if you're waiting an eternity, I figured it's more fun to watch at a better framerate. However, you can try the 1080p version by clicking here. Low end computers beware!</p>
        
        <p>Also, you can toggle antialiasing here if you would like.</p>
